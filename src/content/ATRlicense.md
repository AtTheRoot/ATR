TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Scope
This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this At The Root License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative ork under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Herinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
   
> Question: If this is the scope I want?

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered in this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered ony if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that it is true depends on what the Program does.

> Question: There is not a governing body for Anti-racism, the decentralized approach is where I want to go.

> - Q. International Human Rights law's definition of Racism? - United Nations General Assembly ("UNGA") - in 1963 adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 1965 the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Descrimination ("ICERD") treaty was adopted by the United Nations. The United States signed ICERD in 1966, but did not ratify it for nearly three decades—until October 21, 1994. The Interational Court of Justices ("ICJ") responded to three cases alleging violations under that treaty that have been brought before it. They got bogged down in the definition between ethnicity and race and nationality is not named in the treaty.
> - Q. It's important to know the actors to understand precedence, but I want this to be more of a decentralized approach? I want this to be vague as possible but for the license to have teeth? 
> - Q. Is this enforceable?
> - Q. How would this be enforceable? YES, I really want it to be. It needs to be to some extent to be successful.
> - Nationality should _not_ be named in this License. It is taking the narrative and convolution the meaning/purpose. 
> - Q. How do I solidify that we are referring to race, not nationality and the point is harm by perceived or documented race?
> - Yes, race AND ethnicity based discrimination
> - ! I want the onus to be on the software company to not be racist, rather than people who have been victimized by these programs to prove that they were harmed. Q. How do I word this so it doesn't get too bloated or scary but says that if the ramifications could disenfranchise based on race, it must be addressed. If not addressed, they're liable for suit.
> - ! International law neither defines nor prohibits racism. In the associated article (above), Bradley asserts that addressing racism internationally requires understanding how human rights are violated by racial ideologies in additional to discriminatory acts. 
> - This is coming to pass daily with the international creation and use of technology programs.
> - Widespread accounts of racism document by the United Nations ("UN") human rights groups
> - ! Important for marginalized people should have access to self-determination, even if there is not a structure currently in place, it's a core tenet to the way we enact meaningful change. That being said, although the UN and other international Human Rights organizations may be in partnership, we will not codify hegemonic definitions of race based violence and instead do the reverse: force the leading power structures to recognize the collective experiences of the victims of race-based violence. 
> - ! Race versus Ethnicity: These words are often used interchangeably, but technically, they're defined as separate things. "'Race' and 'ethnicity' have been and continue to be used as ways to describe human diversity," said Nina Jablonski, an anthropologist and palaeobiologist at The Pennsylvania State University, who is known for her research into the evolution of human skin color. "Race is understood by most people as a mixture of physical, behavioral and cultural attributes. Ethnicity recognizes differences between people mostly on the basis of language and shared culture."

> Q. "“policies whose effect is to nullify or impair the equal exercise of human
rights on account of differentiation on account of race, colour, descent or
national or ethnic origin”" <== I don't know if I want it to be necessary to have to impair human rights. Unless equal access and kindness is a human right?
> - **EXAMPLES THIS LICENSE SHOULD COVER**
> - **example.** If a user is getting racially harassed online with target racial words, for the sake of the example, they're middle eastern but a user calls them slurs used for black people. It is then brought to the attention of the software company that there are no blocking features to protect from harassment. The organization does not address. Result: Victim is protected, organization is liable.
> - **example.** If a payment plan service charges more to process fees from a majority asian country. Result: Victims ae not protected, organization is not liable. Then internal communication, or perhaps documentation of their costs/fees show they are trying to limit transactions from Asians and there is no explanation beyond race that these extra fees are needed (hard to prove but ok?). Result: Victims are protected, organiztion is liable.
> - **example.** Video software doesn't detect black faces and goes to market. Result: Victims are protected?? organization is liable. << not sure how to structure this? This product goes to market, but is not explicitly described as having this deficiency, is used in police tracking software and thus has a larger margin of error for black faces than white. Result: Victims are protected, organization is liable.
> - We cannot and should not wait for the international, legal community to define racism.
> - Critical race theory, Third World Approaches to International
Law (“TWAIL”)
> -  **DECLARATION ON RACE AND RACIAL PREJUDICE (1978)** 97
Adopted by the General Conference of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (“UNESCO”) on November 27, 1978, it provides detailed and nuanced reference to
race and racism. It unequivocally states in Article 1 that “all human beings belong to a
single species and are descended from a common stock.” Article 1.2 names a “right to be
different.” Article 2.2 defines racism as including “racist ideologies, prejudiced attitudes,
discriminatory behavior, structural arrangements and institutionalized practices resulting
in racial inequality as well as the fallacious notion that discriminatory relations between
groups are morally and scientifically justifiable. . ..”
> - **DURBAN DECLARATION AND PROGRAM OF ACTION (2001)** 99
A declaration drafted and adopted by governments attending the World Conference
Against Racism (Durban I) in 2001 that was the result of the UN General Assembly’s
Resolution 52/111. The text of the declaration contains numerous uses of the term racism
and links it with racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance. It addresses
compensation for colonialism and for slavery. A draft text of the declaration named Zionism in connection to racism causing the delegations from Israel and the U.S. to withdraw.
> - **DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (2007)**100
Adopted by the UN General Assembly on September 13, 2007, this declaration affirms
that indigenous peoples are equal to all other peoples pursuant to Article 2 and advances
their civil, political, social, economic, and cultural human rights.
