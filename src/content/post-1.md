### We are dedicated to ending the normalized and pervasive exploitation of black and brown people in software.


The only way to do this is to demand the projects we contribute to be actively anti-racist, not just in mission but in practice.

The practice of #stacktivism requires us to place emphasis on what we build and what we build with. We owe it to ourselves and our community to think of the materials we use to build our world and what systems we are enabling through our adoption.

---------------------------
## IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM 

## WHAT DOES ANTI-RACIST CODE LOOK LIKE?
- Emphasizes transparency and accountability
- Has processes in place to eliminate discrimination in code creation and end software use
- Community representation, oversight and saftey measures with independently elected coucil
- Cannot support or contribute to institutions that subjugate and disenfranchise black people: carceral system, detention centers, etc.
- No tolerance for microaggresions, racial transgressions, cultural appropriation, mental and verbal abuse.
- Organization-wide and immediate removal of anyone guilty of sexual misconduct and sexual assault.
- Intersectionality 

## HOW WE ADDRESS IT?

In order to help eliminate racism from our society, we've created the ATP License.

## WHAT WE CAME UP WITH?

## FUTURE VERSIONS
- provide resources for someone to create a pull request for the license and the project
- antiracist checklist

In the open source vain, that propels all innovation forward, both capitalistic and community invested, we cannot in good faith, pretend that the intellectual advancements made with code are not in a vacuum. The implications downstream of the code are our responsibility. The works of tommorow is less about who can acquire the most wealth for black people, but how we can lead the country to a better future; how we [black people] can support ourselves and our own ability to continue to organize and place pressure on those in power. In order to allow that process to unfold we must imagine what it would mean to have truly antiracist software.

### Black futures matter.
Black culture and black consciousness -- Lawrence W. Levine

Liberated black futures. Extreme independence is a trauma response. Do not engage in activities that do not serve us. Energize your heart to create the outcome you wish for and deserve. Stop committing code to projects that don't support or serve you.

Anthropologist Margaret Mead was asked what she considered the first sign of civilization in culture: a femur that had been broken and then healed. Animals would die if they ever had a serious injury. Helping someone else through difficulty is where civilization starts.
Champion change.
