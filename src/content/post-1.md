### We are dedicated to ending the normalized and pervasive exploitation of black and brown people in software.

&nbsp; 

The only way to do this is to demand the projects we contribute to be actively anti-racist, not just in mission but in practice.

The increased interdependence of software of people's lives, the need for the internet to be viewed as a utility, and the context of the politics in 2020 were at the inception of At The Root, by a black queer abolitionist.

> - Protect people interacting with software systems who are harmed on the basis of  race, ethnicity, nationality, caste, phenotype or genotype.
> - Prioritize the lived experience of the most marginalized.
> - Practice intersectionality in our solutions for better technology.
> - Create tools to dismantle opression.

#### What are the counter-arguments to adopting an Ethical Source License for my open source project?
> To answer the question succinctly: There will always be vocal critics of creating a more equitable space for black people. These are not our allies. As we are trying to change institutions one on one, dismantling the tools of oppression, and empower contributors to know that the fruits of our labor are not being used to build a world we do not believe in. We are addressing how software systems are contributing harm of the most melanated, while [some others](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-jshint-learned-the-hard-way-not-to-use-ethical-source-licensing/) do not recognize that remaining neutral enables these systems to flourish and cause more harm.
