### We are dedicated to ending the normalized and pervasive exploitation of black and brown people in software.

- [ ] Do you provide a feedback loop to be alerted of harm, address areas where the code did not prevent harm and remain accountable for the harm done?
- [ ] Does your team have a process for quick deploys to push live changes that address harm?
- [ ] When testing your software before deploy, are your test users from diverse backgrounds and given instructions to check for ways your software could harm its black users?
- [ ] Do you have people of marginalized genders, socio-economic backgrounds, nationality and race contributing to your open source project?
- [ ] Does the way you have implemented your project account for the intersections of the black community that has the potential to be doubly hurt by your software?
- [ ] Are you using industry best practices for storing user data, providing users with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing data, and commit to not storing unnecessary user data?
